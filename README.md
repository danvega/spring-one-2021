This is a collection of code and resources for my presentation at SpringOne 2021 title [Full-Stack Development with Spring Boot and VueJS](https://springone.io/account/talks/165).

Are you interested in building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot and VueJS? If so, this session is going to give you everything you need to get started. First, we’ll dive into some of the challenges of building full-stack applications. Next, we’ll look at some different approaches you can take depending on the types of applications you're building along with the makeup of your team. Finally, we’ll spend most of the session building a sample application together so that when you leave this session, you’ll have everything you need to start building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot and VueJS.
